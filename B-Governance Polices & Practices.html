					  <p>BenLife is committed  in the  fight  against  money  laundering and  terrorism and proliferation financing. It recognizes  its  obligations  as  a covered entity and  upholds the applicable laws, 
					  rules and regulations to ensure that it is not used as a channel for such illegal activities. In this respect, the Company’s Anti-Money Laundering Compliance or AML-Compliance Unit develops, administers,
					  and maintains an effective program for compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) and all of its implementing rules and regulations, and IC, SEC, & AMLC relevant circulars and issuances.
					<br>
					<br>
					 In order to ensure Company-wide compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing (AML/CTF-PF) laws, rules and regulations, the BenLife has adopted and
					 implements a sound Money Laundering  and Terrorist Financing Prevention Program (MTPP), approved by the Board of Directors. It is designed in accordance with the Company’s  corporate structure and  risk profile
					 and is reviewed and updated regularly to incorporate recent regulatory issuances and approved amendments. The Revised MTPP provides guidelines to  combat money laundering and terrorism and proliferation financing 
					 activities, and promotes high ethical and professional standards. 
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 The MTPP is  disseminated to all  officers, employees, as well as agents of BenLife who  are required  by  law and  by  the  Company’s policies  to  implement  the  program. Regular AML trainings and seminars 
					 are also conducted to update the Company’s directors, officers,  employees,  and agents  of  the  latest  AML/CTF  &  PF  requirements, latest trends, emerging risks, and to continuously inform them of their
					 obligations under the AMLA.

					<button class="GPP-accordion_button"> Retirement and Succession Policy</button>
					<div class="accordion-panel">
					  <p>Cognizant of the natural progression of all things, the Board  understands very well that retirement is inevitable. In this regard, the Board  ensures 
					  that the Company adopts an effective succession  planning  program  for  directors, key  officers  and  management, which  includes  a  policy  on  the retirement  age, to ensure  the 
					  continuous  and consistent growth of the Company, increase in shareholder’s value, promote dynamism, and avoid perpetuation in power. 
						<br>
						<br>
						In 2020, through the endorsement of the Corporate  Governance  Committee, the Board  approved the  setting  of  retirement age of directors and officers at eighty (80) and seventy (70) 
						years  old,  respectively,  as  the  general  rule  pursuant  to  <b>Fit  and  Proper  Rule</b>  and  in  consonance  with  the  <b>Department of Finance Order No. 054-2015</b>. Notwithstanding  this 
						general  rule on retirement  age, as  well  as  the  term  limits  prescribed  for  independent  directors,  the  Company  strongly  believes  that  with age often comes unparalleled 
						wisdom and experience, expert business judgment, invaluable industry  and community relations  and authority, and that the best interests of the Company  are  served  by its  being  able 
						to  retain directors  that make very  meaningful and significant contributions  to the Board and  the  organization regardless of age. Hence, the retirement age of eighty (80) years  old 
						for directors under  the  Retirement  Policy  is  not  absolute  as  such  allows  the  Board to waive the same for as long a director  continues  to  be  physically  and  mentally  fit 
						for  the  position  and  able to discharge his/her duties in accordance with the regulatory requirements, and relevant Company policies.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Company’s  Amended  By-laws  provides  the  rules  on  succession, replacement or vacancy in the Board due to retirement or any other reason. Vacancies in the Board may  be  filled up through
						appointment  or  election  of  the remaining  directors, if still constituting a quorum; otherwise, the stockholders shall fill such vacancy in a regular or special meeting called for such 
						purpose. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Directors do not receive any retirement benefits. The Executive Director is eligible for regular retirement benefits given to employees of the Company. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Retirement of Officers is done with the requisite succession planning and in accordance with the Company’s policies and implementing guidelines of its retirement plan for all employees, Labor Code, and the 
						Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines, and all other relevant laws and regulations.  
						<br>
						<br>
						The Company is prudent and exercises due diligence in selecting members of Senior Management. The Board ensures that Management’s Succession Program is effective in identifying and
						preparing the  successors  to  ensure  that the  Company would have high-caliber leaders. A formal process is followed to ensure that a candidate chosen for a Senior Management role is fit
						and  proper  for said key position, taking into account his/her experience in insurance/finance or related field, and integrity, among other requirements. The  process  involves  a 
						candidate  profile  review by Senior Management led by the President through an interview, aside from the Human Resources Group conducting  the  reference  background  check. Furthermore,
						the  candidate  profile  is  also  reviewed  by  the  Nominations  and/or  Corporate  Governance Committees as applicable. If found suitable, the candidate is endorsed to the Board of
						Directors for final appointment approval.
