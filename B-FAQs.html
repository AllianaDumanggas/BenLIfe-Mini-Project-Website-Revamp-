			<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png"/> What is the primary value of life insurance? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Life insurance guarantees the creation of cash, in case of the policyholder’s natural or accidental death, that serves as Income-Continuity Fund for one’s dependents.
						<br>
						And, while the policyholder continues paying his premiums, guaranteed cash values will accumulate (except on term insurance).
						Together with dividend-accumulations, sufficient funds will be made available for education, healthcare, emergency expenses.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">What is the most popular life insurance plan <br> of Beneficial Life? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Among plans paid annually, semi annually or quarterly, our Money Value Plus or MVP plan series is the most popular. 
					  This is because MVP provides for numerous major financial needs, such as income continuity, savings, and retirement funding.</p>

					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">What makes Benlife products distinct from <br>those of other life insurance companies?</button>

					  This is made possible by lowering costs thru efficient operations, and by achieving investment returns above industry averages</p>
					</div>

					<div class="panel">

					<br>Shouldn't I receive an Official Receipt (OR) instead?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>The Official Receipt (OR) will be mailed to the address indicated in your policy application. You should be receiving the OR within thirty (30) days from the time the APR was issued to you by 
					  your agent or from collection date. In case you haven’t received your OR within 30 days, please contact us.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes, the OR will be mailed to the address indicated in your policy application. In case you haven’t received your OR within 30 days, please contact us.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">How can I pay my policy loan? </button>
					<div class="panel">

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">I have an insurance application and paid Benlife.<br> However, it was declined.<br> Can I be refunded for the payment I made? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes. The policy has not yet been issued and your payment was treated as a life insurance deposit.
					  You will be refunded for the amount you paid, less any applicable fees.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">What will happen if I fail to pay my premiums? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>If premiums are not paid within 30 days from the premium due date, and if your policy has no cash value remaining, your Life insurance policy will lapse. 
					  Your family will no longer have any financial protection in case of your natural or accidental death.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">How can I be assured that my policy will not lapse? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>a. You should mark your calendar with the premium due dates/s of your life insurance policy/ies; it is advisable to save or set aside early enough to fund future premiums.
						<br>
						<br>
						b. Be sure to pay your premiums on the due date, or within the Grace Period of 30 days from the premium due date.
						<br>
						<br>
						b.1. You may pay premiums to your servicing agent or to our regional/head office cashier. You will receive a Temporary Receipt from our agent who in turn will remit 
						this to our Head Office or Regional Office Cashier. The Cashier issues an Official Receipt in your name. The agent will then replace your Temporary Receipt with said official receipt.
						<br>
						<br>
						b.2. Or, you may deposit your premiums to any branch of Philippine National Bank, Union Bank or United Coconut Planters Bank. Be sure to use the 
						“Bills Payment” deposit slip forms, and indicate your full name and life insurance policy number in every deposit slip.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">How can I continue to be insured<br> even without having to pay any premiums? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>After 2 or 3 years of premium payment, cash value credits of your policy can be used as one-time premium, to pay for the same amount of insurance-but shorter period, or smaller
					  amount of insurance for the same period of coverage. Actual values are printed in the policy.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">I have a MAP and I want to surrender the policy after 3 full years of payment. Will I get all the money I paid? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>All you can get is the equivalent cash surrender value at 3rd yr and the accumulated dividends. It is stated on the policy provisions that you can only get 
					  the cash value equivalent to the number of years that you have paid your plan plus the dividends.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">The plan I got has a WPD rider. I was hospitalized and was advice to rest for 1 month. Can the company 
					waive the premium due when I was hospitalized? Or is there any benefit that I can get from the company? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>As per WPD clause, only those that are validated / evaluated as total and permanent disability, we can apply the waiver of premiums until the policy is fully paid or until the maturity of the plan. If your plan has an HIB rider, then the company will give you the appropriate amount depending on the HIB/day and only on an aggregate of 30 days per year. The policyholder needs
					  to present the original billing statement and Medical certificate. However, the premium must be up to date at the time of the confinement.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">My child has an Academic Plan and is now 16 yrs old.<br> When and how can we get the college benefit? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Do you mean the trustor? Yes we can change this as long as the payor has a written request regarding the change of name. You can also change the payor as long as the person
					  who will become the payor is in good health and that our acceptable age of the payor is only up to age 55</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">If the scholar does not continue his <br>college education, can we still get the college benefit? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes, as long as you present to us the birth certificate of the insured.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">When can I apply for a policy loan? And how much? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>At the end of the 3rd policy year then you can apply for a policy loan. <br>The loan value will depend on the number of completed years paid. 
					  The loan can be released on the same day.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">Can I apply for a loan against my dollar account?<br> Can I get it immediately? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes you can apply for a policy loan on your dollar policy after 3 full yrs of premium of payments. We can release to you loan amount on the same day if we will convert it to Philippine peso, 
					  or if you have a dollar account with PNB then we can transfer this to your account. However if you want it in U.S. dollar, then we will release it on the following day.
					<br>
					<br>
					This will also be the process when you surrender your policy. You have to surrender the original policy contract and photocopy of your identification with signature.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">Can I change my beneficiaries? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes You can change your beneficiaries anytime. However, if your beneficiary designation is IRREVOCABLE then they have to sign. the amendment form.
					  If the beneficiary designation is REVOCABLE, then the signature of the insured is enough.</p>
					</div>
					
					<button class="accordion"><img src="Images/FAQs.png">I am the insured. Can I change the name <br>of the insured to one of my beneficiaries? </button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>No. Because the premium payment is not transferable. And that the evaluation made by our Underwriting Dept.
					  is based on the n application and information made by the insured.</p>
